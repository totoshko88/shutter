# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document describes the requirements for modernizing the Shutter screenshot system to ensure reliable operation on Wayland with support for multiple backends. The project should automatically detect available screenshot tools depending on the operating system and desktop environment, resolve dependencies, and eliminate blockers for Wayland operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic System Environment Detection

**User Story:** As a Shutter user, I want the application to automatically detect my system environment (DE, compositor, available tools), so that it can choose the best available backend for taking screenshots.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Shutter starts THEN the system SHALL determine the current session type (X11/Wayland)
2. WHEN the system runs on Wayland THEN the application SHALL identify the current desktop environment (GNOME/KDE/COSMIC/Sway/other)
3. WHEN the system identifies DE THEN the application SHALL check for availability of corresponding screenshot tools
4. WHEN all checks are completed THEN the system SHALL create a list of available backends in priority order

### Requirement 2: Support for All Major Screenshot Backends

**User Story:** As a user of different DEs on Wayland, I want Shutter to support all major screenshot tools, so that I can use the application regardless of my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs on COSMIC THEN the application SHALL support cosmic-screenshot for fullscreen and selection screenshots
2. WHEN the system runs on GNOME THEN the application SHALL support GNOME Screenshot via D-Bus API
3. WHEN the system runs on KDE THEN the application SHALL support Spectacle for window and fullscreen screenshots
4. WHEN the system runs on wlroots-based compositor THEN the application SHALL support grim+slurp for all screenshot types
5. WHEN no specialized backend is available THEN the system SHALL use xdg-desktop-portal as fallback
6. WHEN a backend supports the functionality THEN the system SHALL provide support for Selection and Desktop modes

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Backend Configuration System

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want to be able to configure backend priority or force use of a specific backend, so that I have full control over the application behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens preferences THEN the system SHALL show available backend selection options
2. WHEN the user chooses "Auto" THEN the system SHALL use automatic detection with fallback chain
3. WHEN the user chooses a specific backend THEN the system SHALL use only that backend
4. WHEN the selected backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show an error message with alternative suggestions
5. WHEN the user sets environment variables THEN the system SHALL consider them when selecting backends

### Requirement 4: Automatic Dependency Checking and Installation

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to receive clear messages about missing dependencies and installation instructions, so that I can quickly set up a working application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system finds no working backend THEN the application SHALL show a dialog with installation instructions
2. WHEN a specific tool is missing THEN the system SHALL show the installation command for the current distribution
3. WHEN the user installs new tools THEN the system SHALL automatically update the list of available backends
4. WHEN the system detects version conflicts THEN the application SHALL show warnings with recommendations

### Requirement 5: Reliable Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to continue working even if one of the backends fails, using alternative screenshot methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the primary backend fails THEN the system SHALL automatically try the next available backend
2. WHEN all specialized backends fail THEN the system SHALL use xdg-desktop-portal
3. WHEN the portal is also unavailable THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message
4. WHEN a timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL abort the operation and try an alternative method
5. WHEN the user cancels the operation THEN the system SHALL handle cancellation correctly without errors

### Requirement 6: Support for All Screenshot Types

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to create different types of screenshots (fullscreen, selection, window) regardless of the backend being used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user chooses fullscreen screenshot THEN the system SHALL capture the entire screen through available backend
2. WHEN the user chooses selection area THEN the system SHALL provide an interactive area selection tool
3. WHEN the user chooses window THEN the system SHALL capture the active or selected window (if supported by backend)
4. WHEN a backend doesn't support a specific type THEN the system SHALL use an alternative method or show a message
5. WHEN a screenshot is created THEN the system SHALL return it in standard format for further processing

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have reliable tests for checking the operation of all backends, so that I can guarantee application stability in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL check availability of each backend
2. WHEN a backend is tested THEN the system SHALL verify its ability to create screenshots of different types
3. WHEN configuration is tested THEN the system SHALL verify correct saving and loading of settings
4. WHEN fallback logic is tested THEN the system SHALL simulate backend unavailability and verify switching
5. WHEN tests are completed THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed report on the status of each component
